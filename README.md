# BioStack


### **BioStack — One link. Your complete professional story.**

BioStack is a platform that lets users create, host, and manage a dynamic personal profile through a single shareable link. Instead of static resumes or outdated portfolios, BioStack provides a living profile that can be edited anytime and shared instantly with recruiters, clients, or friends.

Users can showcase their skills, projects, experience, and links in one place—fully customizable, always up to date, and accessible from anywhere.

BioStack turns your online presence into a flexible professional identity, not just a portfolio.
